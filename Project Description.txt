The mymatrix class provides a matrix (2D array) abstraction.
The size can grow dynamically in both directions (rows and cols).  
Also, rows can be "jagged" --- i.e. rows can have different column sizes, 
and thus the matrix is not necessarily rectangular.

"mymatrix.h" contains the code for the functioning matrix abstraction, while "main.cpp" contains
test cases designed to ensure the program functions properly.
